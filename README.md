This is a simple project using machine learning and computer vision. The main goal of this project is to make the machine recognize food that has been photographed by the user. From a small dataset of 13 food items the capabilities of this project is obviously very limited. The model would be mounted on Gradio, and is able to be hosted on a local PC.
